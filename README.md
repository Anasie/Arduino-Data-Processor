# Arduino-Data-Processor
The code enables an arduino board (or any board) to process loads of sets of values
- So basically the code turns CSV into an array of 20 values, the values should be typed in the serial monitor separated with ,of course, commas, then the code enables the board to recognize each value and assign it to its respective index.
